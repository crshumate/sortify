sortify
=======

An all-in-one pagination/refinement/sorting jQuery plugin 

*Once development on this plugin is finished I will write out clear documentation*

Warning
--------

This plugin is still in pre-alpha stage. ie: There are hard coded classes etc. that need to be tied into the plugin settings. That said if you open sortify.html in your browser you will see this plugin working. 

If you are working within the framework of an eCommerce platform you most likely will not need this plugin at all. However it can be beneficial for anyone not working in an eCommerce platform.
